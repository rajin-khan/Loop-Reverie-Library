### **The Pattern**

#### **Part 1: The Flower (Make 5)**

Each flower consists of 5 identical petals worked into a central magic ring.

1.  **Start** with a Magic Ring and secure it with a **ch 1**.
2.  **Petal 1:**
    *   **Ch 4**.
    *   Work **2 trc** into the MR.
    *   **Ch 4**.
    *   **Sl st** back into the MR.
3.  **Petals 2-5:** Repeat the instructions for Petal 1 four more times to create a total of 5 petals. You can gently tighten the magic ring as you go.
4.  **Finish:** After the final slip stitch for the 5th petal, cut a short yarn tail and pull it through to fasten off.
5.  **Close the Ring:** Pull the initial magic ring tail to close the center hole, but **leave a small opening** large enough for the wire stem to pass through. Tie the two yarn ends in a loose knot to secure.

#### **Part 2: Assembly**

1.  **Prepare the Stems:** You need one long stem and four short stems.
    *   **Long Stem (x1):** Take a long piece of floral wire. Wrap the first few inches of the tip with **yellow yarn** and secure with glue. The rest of the wire can be bare for now.
    *   **Short Stems (x4):** Cut four shorter pieces of floral wire. Wrap about 3/4 of each stem with **green yarn** and the final 1/4 (the tip) with **yellow yarn**. Secure with glue.

2.  **Attach Flowers to Stems:**
    *   Take one flower and the **long stem**. Carefully push the yellow tip through the center hole of the flower from back to front. The yellow yarn will form the center of the flower.
    *   Apply glue to the base of the flower on the underside to secure it to the wire.
    *   Repeat this process for the other four flowers using the **short stems**.

3.  **Create the Bunch:**
    *   Once the glue is dry, take the four short-stemmed flowers and arrange them around the main flower on the long stem. Give the short stems a gentle bend to position them nicely.
    *   Using your **green yarn**, tie a secure knot around the point where all the wire stems meet.
    *   Apply a generous amount of glue to this junction. Tightly wrap the green yarn around all the wires, starting from the top and working your way down. This will cover the wire ends and bind all the flowers into a single, sturdy stem.
    *   Continue wrapping until all the short wire ends are covered and the stem looks uniform.

4.  **Finish the Stem:** Secure the end of the green yarn with glue. Once dry, you can cut the main stem to your desired length. Spread the flowers out to shape your cluster.
