### **Simple Stuffed Tulip Crochet Pattern**

This pattern creates the 3D stuffed head of a tulip. It is worked in continuous rounds, so you will not join at the end of each round.

### **The Pattern**

#### **Part 1: Crocheting the Tulip Head**

1.  **Start** with a Magic Ring.
2.  **R1:** Work 6 sc into the MR. (6 sts)
3.  **R2:** Work 1 sc increase in each of the 6 stitches around. (12 sts)
4.  **R3:** **\***SC in the next stitch, then 1 sc increase in the next stitch.**\*** Repeat from \* to \* 6 times total. (18 sts)
5.  **R4:** **\***SC in the next 2 stitches, then 1 sc increase in the next stitch.**\*** Repeat from \* to \* 6 times total. (24 sts)
6.  **R5-12 (8 rounds total):** Work 1 sc in each stitch around. (24 sts for each round)

*At the end of Round 12, do not fasten off yet. Your project will look like a small cup.*

#### **Part 2: Stuffing and Shaping**

1.  **Stuff** the tulip head firmly with polyester fiber.
2.  **End the last round** with a slip stitch to the next stitch to even out the edge. Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail (about 10 inches / 25cm) for sewing.
3.  **Thread** the yarn tail onto your tapestry needle.
4.  **Flatten** the opening of the tulip so the edges meet. Use your needle to sew a straight line across the opening, stitching the front and back edges together to close the top.
5.  **Create the tulip shape:** Take the two corners (ends) of the seam you just created and bring them together at the center.
6.  **Stitch** these two corners together securely at the center of the seam. Sew through them 2-3 times to make sure they are strong. This will pull the top inwards and create the classic indented tulip shape.
7.  Fasten off securely and insert the remaining yarn tail down into the flower to hide it.

You now have a completed tulip head.
