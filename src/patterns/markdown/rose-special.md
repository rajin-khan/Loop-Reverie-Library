### **Detailed Multi-Part Rose Pattern**

This pattern creates a realistic rose by making individual petals, leaves, and a base, which are then assembled.

*   **Yarn** in at least three colors (petal color, green for leaves/torus)
*   **Crochet Hook**
*   **Floral Wire** (for the leaves)
*   **Scissors**
*   **Darning Needle**

**Stitches Used (US Terms)**
*   **ch** = Chain
*   **slst** = Slip Stitch
*   **sc** = Single Crochet
*   **hdc** = Half Double Crochet
*   **dc** = Double Crochet

**Special Techniques**
*   **Magic Ring:** A starting technique for crocheting in the round. Also called a double ring or magic circle.
*   **Increase (inc):** Work two stitches in the same stitch (e.g., "SC inc" means 2 SC in the same stitch).
*   **Picot Stitch:** Ch 3, then slst into the first chain you made. This creates a small decorative bump.
