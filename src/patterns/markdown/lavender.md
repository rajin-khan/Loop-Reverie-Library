### **The Pattern**

#### **Part 1: Crocheting the Flower**

This entire piece is worked into a single foundation chain.

1.  With your purple yarn, make a slip knot and **ch 48**.
    *   *Note: For the best curling effect, you will work into the **top loop only** of each chain, not through both loops.*

2.  **Create the Top of the Flower:**
    *   Identify the **3rd chain from your hook**.
    *   In that same chain, work the following sequence: **(3 dc, ch 3, 1 sl st)**. This creates the rounded top of the lavender.

3.  **Create the Side Florets (Petals):**
    *   Move to the **very next chain** on your foundation.
    *   In that chain, work: **(1 sl st, ch 6, 1 sl st)**. This creates the first little loop on the side of the stalk.

4.  **Repeat:**
    *   Continue working the pattern from Step 3 — **(1 sl st, ch 6, 1 sl st)** — in *each remaining chain* all the way down to the end.

5.  **Finish:**
    *   Once you've worked into the very last chain, fasten off. You only need a short tail. The crocheted piece will be tightly coiled.

#### **Part 2: Assembly**

1.  **Prepare the Stem:** If you are using plain wire, you can wrap it with green yarn first. Apply a line of glue to the wire and tightly wrap the green yarn around it. Let it dry.

2.  **Attach the Flower:** Take the top of your crocheted piece (the end with the 3-dc cluster). Apply a dot of hot glue to the tip of your wire stem and press this top part firmly onto it.

3.  **Wrap the Flower:** Add a line of glue down the stem. Begin to wrap the coiled crochet piece in a spiral around the wire. Continue adding glue in sections and wrapping until you reach the end of the crocheted piece. You can make the gaps between the coils as tight or as loose as you like.

4.  **Secure the End:** When you get to the bottom, you will have two small yarn tails (from the start and end). Tie them together in a simple knot. Add a final dot of glue to secure the knot to the stem.

5.  **Trim:** Once the glue is dry, snip off the excess yarn tails and trim the wire stem to your desired length with wire cutters.
