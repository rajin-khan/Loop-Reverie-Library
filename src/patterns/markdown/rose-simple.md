### **The Pattern**

#### **Row 1: The Foundation**
1.  Make a slip knot and **ch 66**.
2.  In the **6th ch** from the hook, work **1 dc**.
3.  **\*sk 2 chains, then work a V-Stitch (1 dc, ch 2, 1 dc) into the next chain.**
4.  Repeat from \* all the way to the end. You will work your final V-Stitch in the last chain.

#### **Row 2: The Petal Base**
1.  **Ch 2** and turn your work.
2.  In the ch-2 space of the first V-Stitch, work a **Petal Cluster (2 dc, ch 3, 2 dc)**.
3.  Work one **Petal Cluster** in the ch-2 space of *every* V-Stitch from the previous row.

*Your project will now be very wavy and curled. This is correct!*

#### **Row 3: The Petals**
1.  **Ch 1** and turn your work.
2.  **\*In the first ch-3 space, work 7 dc. Then, work 1 sc in the gap between that cluster and the next one.**
3.  Repeat from \* all the way across the row.
4.  After your final group of 7 dc, work **1 sc** into the top of the ch-2 turning chain from the start of Row 2.

#### **Step 4: Finishing and Assembly**
1.  **Ch 1** and cut your yarn, leaving a very long tail (about 15 inches). Pull the tail through to fasten off.
2.  Start rolling the strip from the end **without** the yarn tails.
3.  Hold the rose firmly at the base and use your darning needle and the long tail to sew back and forth through all the bottom layers, securing the shape.
4.  Weave in your ends. You're done.
