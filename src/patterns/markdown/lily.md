*   **Round 1 (Petal Shape):**
    1.  Start with a slip knot and **ch 20**.
    2.  **First Side:** Starting in the 2nd ch from the hook, work down the chain:
        *   1 sc in the first st.
        *   1 hdc in the next st.
        *   1 dc in each of the next 12 sts.
        *   1 hdc in each of the next 2 sts.
        *   1 sc in each of the next 2 sts.
    3.  **Tip:** Work **3 sc** in the last chain. Place a stitch marker in the middle (2nd) of these 3 sc.
    4.  **Second Side:** Working along the opposite side of the foundation chain:
        *   1 sc in each of the next 2 sts.
        *   1 hdc in each of the next 2 sts.
        *   1 dc in each of the next 12 sts.
        *   1 hdc in the next st.

    7.  Work **1 hdc** in each of the next **15 sts**.
    8.  Work **1 sc** in the last stitch.

### **Assembly**

1.  **Start the Stem:** Take your bamboo stick. Apply hot glue to the tip and attach the stamen.
2.  **Add Petals (Layer 1):** Arrange **3 petals** evenly around the stamen. Use hot glue to secure them to the stem. Begin wrapping the stem with green yarn to cover the base of the petals.
3.  **Add Petals (Layer 2):** A little further down the stem, add the remaining **4 petals**. Place them in the gaps between the first layer of petals. Secure with glue and continue wrapping the stem.
4.  **Add the Leaf/Leaves:** Place the leaf (or leaves) against the stem where you want them. Secure with hot glue and continue wrapping the green yarn down the stem, trapping the leaf wires as you go.
5.  **Finish:** Continue wrapping until the stem is covered. Secure the end of the yarn with a final dot of hot glue.
6.  **Shape:** Gently bend the wires in the petals and leaves to give your lily a natural, open shape.
