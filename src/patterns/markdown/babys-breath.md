### **The Pattern: Small Flower (Make 8)**

The flower is made in two rounds from a central ring.

#### **Round 1: The Base**

1.  **Start** with a Magic Ring.
2.  **Ch 1** (this does not count as a stitch).
3.  Work **5 sc** into the MR.
4.  Pull the tail to close the ring tightly.
5.  **Sl st** into the first sc to join the round. (5 sts)

#### **Round 2: The Petals**

You will create 5 petals, one in each stitch from Round 1.

1.  **Petal 1:**
    *   **Ch 3**.
    *   Starting in the 2nd ch from the hook, work **1 sc**.
    *   Work **1 sc** in the next ch.
    *   **Sl st** into the *next available stitch* on the base circle (from R1).

2.  **Petals 2-5:** Repeat the instructions for Petal 1 four more times. You will work your way around the base circle, creating one petal in each stitch.

3.  **Finish:** After completing the 5th petal and making the final slip stitch, cut the yarn, leaving a tail. Pull the tail through to fasten off. Use a tapestry needle to weave the tails to the back and center of the flower.

### **Assembly**

1.  Create 8 individual small flowers.
2.  Cut 8 short pieces of craft wire for the stems.
3.  Insert one wire through the center of each flower to act as a stem. You can add a dab of glue at the base to secure it if needed.
4.  Gather the 8 flower stems together to form a single bunch of Baby's Breath. You can wrap the collected stems with green yarn or floral tape to create a unified stem.
